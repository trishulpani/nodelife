##Nodelife

A very primitive - yet highly playable version - of the now famous [Lifeline](http://3mingames.com/2015/04/lifeline/) game using NodeJS, jQuery, Boostrap and ExpressJS. 

Things to do next:

- Add additional button choices and game flows.

- Play around some more with the presentation and work on any suggestions that people like you may have.

- Pray that I don't run into any copyright issues.


###To Run this on your local

Assuming that you have Node installed, you will need to:

1. Download / Pull code from this repo.

2. Run `npm install` on the root folder.

3. Run the app my using `node index.js`

4. Access the application from http://localhost:3000

Feel free to let me know if you have any feedback!

Thanks!!
