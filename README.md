##Nodelife

A very primitive - yet highly playable version - of the now famous [http://3mingames.com/2015/04/lifeline/](Lifeline) game using NodeJS, jQuery, Boostrap and ExpressJS. 

Things to do next
	1. Add additional button choices and game flows.
	2. Play around some more with the presentation and work on any suggestions that people like you may have.
	3. Pray that I don't run into any copyright issues.
